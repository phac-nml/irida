REST API
========
{:.no_toc}

This document describes the REST API for IRIDA.

* This comment becomes the toc
{:toc}

Formats
=======

The IRIDA REST API follows a standard output format, regardless of the resource being accessed. Resources can be accessed in two ways:

  1. As an individual resource,
  2. As part of a resource collection.

Both XML and JSON are valid output formats for all resources. Some resources (notably resources representing files produced by a sequencer stored on the file-system) support output in FASTA or FASTQ format.

JSON Format
-----------
{:.no_toc}

### Individual Resource
{:.no_toc}

Resources requested in JSON format will always have the following structure:

```json
{
  "resource" : {
    "links" : [ {
      "rel" : "self",
      "href" : "http://www.example.com"
    }, {
      "rel" : "magic/link",
      "href" : "http://www.example.com/magic"
    }, ...
    ],
    "resourceProperty1" : "resourceValue",
    "resourceProperty2" : "resourceValue",
    ...
  },
}
```

The entire response consists of the `resource` object. The `resource` object contains links related to the current resource as well as the properties of the resource.

The `resource` section contains an array of link objects under the `links` key. Each link has a `rel` and an `href`. In addition to the `links` section, the `resource` section contains all properties associated with the resource.

### Resource Collection
{:.no_toc}

Resource collections requested in JSON format will always have the following structure:

```json
{
  "resource" : {
    "links" : [ {
      "rel" : "magic/link",
      "href" : "http://www.example.com/magic"
    }, {
      "rel" : "self",
      "href" : "http://www.example.com"
    }, ...
    ],
    "resources" : [ {
      "links" : [ {
        "rel" : "self",
        "href" : "http://www.example.com/resources/1"
      } ],
      "resourceProperty" : "resourceValue",
      "resourceProperty2" : "resourceValue2",
      ...
      }, {
      ...
    } ]
  }
}
```

Similar to requesting an individual resource, a resource collection is wrapped with a `resource` object. Within the `resource` object is an array of links, and an array of `resources`. The `resources` array may contain complete records for the resource in the resource collection. If the record is not complete, each entry in the `resources` array will have links about that specific resource to get more information.

Authentication
==============

IRIDA does not allow any un-authenticated interaction with the REST API. IRIDA uses [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) for authentication and authorization of clients. Command-line tools must use the password grant type for OAuth2. Our examples are primarily showing how to interact with the IRIDA REST API over the using the password flow. IRIDA also supports the authorization code flow, so other web services can interact with IRIDA.

Most programming languages have libraries with convenient interfaces for dealing with OAuth2 authorization. We provide some examples for the programming languages where we've written our own clients, but a comprehensive list of libraries can be found here: <http://oauth.net/code/>

### Java
{:.no_toc}

For Java, we recommend that you use [Spring Security OAuth2](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/) or [Apache OLTU](https://oltu.apache.org/). We internally use Spring Security OAuth2 to implement server-side OAuth2.

### Python
{:.no_toc}

For Python, we recommend that you use [Rauth](http://rauth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) or [Requests-OAuthlib](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

A complete application that uses Rauth is the [IRIDA SISTR results exporter](https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-sistr-results) for IRIDA.

Another option for using Python with IRIDA is the [Requests-OAuthlib](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

A complete example application that uses Requests-OAuthlib is the [IRIDA Galaxy Import Tool](https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-galaxy-importer). This application uses the authorization code flow.

### Perl
{:.no_toc}

For Perl, we recommend that you use the [`OAuth::Lite2::Client::UsernameAndPassword`](https://metacpan.org/pod/OAuth::Lite2::Client::UsernameAndPassword) package. 

A complete application that uses `OAuth::Lite2::Client::UsernameAndPassword` is the [command-line linker](https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-linker) tool for IRIDA.

### HTTP
{:.no_toc}

If you *really* want to interact with IRIDA on the command line, or with an esoteric programming language that hasn't yet built an OAuth2 library, you can do so with basic HTTP. The example provided here shows how to use the password flow (you can't really use the authorization code flow without a web browser...) using shell and `curl`:

```bash
curl --silent http://localhost:8080/irida/api/oauth/token -X POST -d "client_id=$CLIENT_ID&client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=password&username=$USERNAME&password=$PASSWORD" | python -m json.tool
```

In the example above, you would need to replace `$CLIENT_ID`, `$CLIENT_SECRET`, `$USERNAME` and `$PASSWORD` with your own client and user credentials. The `--silent` option on `curl` suppresses the progress display, and `python -m json.tool` will pretty-print the JSON that the server responds with.

An example response from the server is:

```json
{
  "access_token": "my-53cr37-04u7h-4cc355-70k3n",
  "expires_in": 43199,
  "scope": "read write",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

Now, to access any other resources in the REST API you must include the `access_token` value in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl --silent http://localhost:8080/irida/api/projects/1 \\
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer my-53cr37-04u7h-4cc355-70k3n' | python -m json.tool
```

General Contracts
=================

### Formats

By default, IRIDA will respond to requests with JSON if no `Accept` is specified. IRIDA can also generally respond to requests for `application/xml`. Some resources (specifically marked) will be able to respond to requests for `application/fastq` and `application/fasta`.

All timestamps in IRIDA are returned in **milliseconds** since the [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

### Client Errors

As in the [authentication](#authentication) section, all resources in the IRIDA REST API are protected and require authorization to access. Clients attempting to access *any* URL under the `/api` path without an authorization token will receive an HTTP `401 Unauthorized` response, regardless of the existence of a resource.

When sending resources to the server, the following will result in `400 Bad Request`:

* Sending invalid JSON (malformed, wrong type of quotes, etc.).
* Sending data that is considered invalid (field length is too short, for example).
* Sending data that includes unexpected fields (the server will respond with a list of acceptable field names).

Some resources may not respond to all HTTP verbs. If an HTTP verb is not supported, the response will be `405 Request method not supported`.

If you are not permitted to execute an HTTP verb on a resource, the response will be `403 Forbidden`.

### HTTP Verbs

All endpoints will respond to HTTP `GET` requests.

[Resource collections](#resource-collection) will respond to HTTP `POST` requests to create a new instance of that resource.

[Individual resources](#individual-resource) will respond to HTTP `PATCH` requests to update a resource and `DELETE` requests to delete a resource (if the resource is allowed to be deleted). A response of `403 Forbidden` will be issued if you are not permitted to modify or delete a resource (you may have read-only permissions).

Root Endpoints
==============

To begin accessing IRIDA, you can issue a `GET` request to get a collection of links to the top-level resources:

```bash
$ curl http://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/api
```

The root resource returned matches the [individual resource](#individual-resource) format.

### Links
{:.no_toc}

The root endpoint has links to the top-level resource collections in IRIDA.

| Name       | Description             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `self`       | the root resource           |
| `projects`     | the collection of project resources |
| `users`      | the collection of user resources  |
| `sequencingRuns` | the collection of sequencing runs (only administrative users can access this collection) |
| `analysisSubmissions` | the collection of analysis submissions created by the current user account |
| `version` | the builds IRIDA version string |

Resources
=========

IRIDA has several major resources:

1. [Users](#users)
2. [Projects](#projects)
  * [Samples](#samples)
  * [Sequence files](#sequence-files)
3. [Sequencing Runs](#sequencing-runs)

### Sequence Files

Each sample will refer to a [collection of sequence files](#sequence-file-collection) that have been sequenced and uploaded to IRIDA. Every record in the sequence files resource collection has a `self` rel to access the [individual sequence file](#sequence-file-individual).

The sample will also contain a [list of paired-end sequence files](#sequence-file-pairs-collection) and [individual paired-end files](#sequence-file-pairs-individual).

### Sequencing Runs

#### Sequencing Run Collection
{:.no_toc}

[Sequence files](#sequence-files) are commonly uploaded to IRIDA as part of a set of files generated by a single execution of a sequencer. Sequencing runs can only be viewed by administrative user accounts. Each record in the sequencing runs collection has a `self` rel that can be used to access details about the individual sequencing run resource.

#### Creating Sequencing Runs
{:.no_toc}
**Deprecation notice (v20.05)**
Previously the IRIDA REST API planned to have different endpoints for different sequencer types.  In those versions, the `sequencingRun/miseq` endpoint allowed you to `POST` a run specifically for the *MiSeq* sequencer, but other sequencers were not officially supported.  As of IRIDA 20.05, any sequencer types are supported by `POST`ing a run to the SequencingRun collection endpoint (`/api/sequencingrun`) with the values in the properties section below.

The `sequencingRun/miseq` endpoint will be maintained for a few versions for legacy purposes, but will be removed out in the near future.  It is recommended for you to stay up to date with the latest version of the [IRIDA Uploader](https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-uploader) to ensure compatibility.

**Creating Legacy MiSeq Runs (Deprecated)**

Sequencing runs are created differently from other resources.  To differentiate between different sequencer models alternate endpoints are exposed to create runs for each model.  To create a Sequencing Run for a given sequencer, `POST` the resource to the specific endpoint for that sequencer.  The following rels are enabled:

|Sequencer     | Rel |
|--------------|-------------|
|Illumina Miseq| `sequencingRun/miseq` |


#### Sequencing Run Individual
{:.no_toc}

A sequencing run contains a reference to all of the files that were generated by the same execution of a sequencer (may span many samples). The run resource also contains metadata captured when the files were uploaded (on Illumina this is metadata in the `SampleSheet.csv` file).

#### Sequencing Run Upload Status
{:.no_toc}
Sequencing Run has a special property, `uploadStatus`, which is used to track the status of a Sequencing Run upload.  `uploadStatus` should be updated by the uploader client to reflect the status of the sequencing run upload.

| Value       | Description                                                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UPLOADING` | Default value.  Run is created and files are currently being uploaded. |
| `COMPLETE`  | The run and sequence files have been successfully uploaded.            |
| `ERROR`     | An error occurred while the run was being uploaded.                    |

### Analysis Submissions

An analysis submission can provide clients with the complete set of inputs (consisting of [sequence files](#sequence-files) and workflow parameters), the selected IRIDA workflow, and the outputs of a completed analysis. The API provides convenient endpoints for filtering on the different types of workflows in IRIDA, currently assembly and annotation and phylogenomics.

#### Analysis Submissions Collection
{:.no_toc}

The collection of analysis submissions is the complete set of **all** analysis that the currently logged-in user has submitted for execution in IRIDA. You can filter on the different types of analysis by following the links below.

##### Links
{:.no_toc}

If your client needs to know about the specific types of outputs available to it, you should generally follow the link to the specific type of analysis that you're looking for rather than listing the entire collection of analysis for the user. For example, if your client is interested in showing some results using a phylogenetic tree, then you should configure your client to immediately follow the `analysisSubmissions/phylogenomics` link.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `self` | A link to the collection of analysis submissions for this user. |
| `analysisSubmissions/phylogenomics` | A link to the collection of phylogenomics analysis that this user has submitted. |
| `analysisSubmissions/assembly` | A link to the collection of assembly and annotation analysis that this user has submitted. |
| `analysisSubmissions/assembly-collection` | A link to the collection of assembly and annotation collection analysis that this user has submitted. |
| `analysisSubmissions/sistr` | A link to the collection of SISTR Typing analysis that this user has submitted. |

#### Analysis Submission Individual
{:.no_toc}

Each analysis submission corresponds to a collection of inputs (files and parameters), and a collection of outputs. The outputs for an analysis submission depend on the type of analysis that was submitted. Analysis submissions and analysis outputs are immutable once created.

##### Links
{:.no_toc}

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `self` | A link to this analysis submission. |
| `analysis` | A link to the **completed** analysis created for this submission. This link will only appear when the analysis submission is in the `COMPLETED` state. |
| `input/paired` | A link to the collection of paired-end input files used for this analysis. See [Sequence File Pairs Collection](#sequence-file-pairs-collection) for response format.|
| `input/unpaired` | A link to the collection of single-end input files used for this analysis.  See [Sequence File Collection](#sequence-file-collection) for response format. |

### Analysis

An analysis is the final resulting outputs of an [analysis submission](#analysis-submissions). You must follow the `analysis` link from an analysis submission, once it's completed.

#### Links
{:.no_toc}

The links for an anlysis generally correspond to the files that are produced as output from a specific type of analysis submission. You can infer the type of analysis submission based on the filter link that you used to list the analysis submissions. For example, if you filtered analysis submissions using the `analysisSubmissions/assembly` link, then the linked type of analysis will have output links corresponding to the assembly and annotation pipeline.

To access the file contents of each analysis output, use an `Accept` header of `text/plain`.
