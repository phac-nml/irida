### Remote instances of IRIDA

Remote instances of IRIDA can be used as data sources for associated projects and workflows.  The "Remote IRIDA Connections" section allows users to connect to remote instances of IRIDA.  

**Note**: You must have been provided with a username and password for a remote instance of IRIDA before you can use the data located on that instance.

Administrators can add or remove available remote instances of IRIDA from this menu.  Details can be found in the [administrator guide](../../administrator/#managing-remote-irida-connections).
