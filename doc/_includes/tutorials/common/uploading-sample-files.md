### Sequence Files & Assemblies

Sequence files can be uploaded by either dragging and dropping the files into the upload section, or by clicking the section and selecting the files. Sequence, fast5, and assembly files can be uploaded at the same time.

* **Upload Sequence Files** - Files must have the extension `.fastq` or `.fastq.gz`, all other formats will be ignored.  You can select single or multiple files in the system file selection window.  If you are uploading paired end data, ensure they are selected in the same upload.
* **Upload Fast5 Files**  - Files must have the extension `.fast5` or `.fast5.tar.gz`.

* **Upload Assembly** - Assembly files must have the extension `.fasta` or `.fna`.

Uploading of files will begin immediately. A progress bar for each of the file types (sequence, assembly, and fast5 files) will be displayed with the status of the upload. Also, expandable panels for each of the file types will be displayed below each progress bar which can be expanded to show the files that are uploading.  If you need to cancel an upload click the **Cancel Upload** button.  **Do not close the sample details viewer or refresh the page as this will cancel the upload**.
