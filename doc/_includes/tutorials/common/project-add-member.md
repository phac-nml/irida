To add an individual project member, click on the "Add Member" button:

You can use the dialog that appears to select a user account. You can also select the **Project Role** and **Metadata Role** that the new member should have. If the **Project Role** is set to **Manager** then the **Metadata Role** will default to the highest level (Level 4):

**Remember**: a project collaborator has *read-only* permissions, and a project *manager* is allowed to modify project details.

Once you've selected the user and role to add to the project, click on the "OK" button.
