## Sharing and Moving Samples

Sharing and moving samples has been completely re-designed for the January 2022 release of IRIDA in an effort to allow
faster sharing or moving greater number of samples. It is important to remember that you must be a manager on both the
current project and the project you are trying to share or move samples to.

Samples can be selected on either the project samples page or the linelist page:

1. Project Samples Page: Click the "Sample Tools" dropdown and select "Share / Move Samples".
2. Linelist Page: click the "Share Samples" button.

Once selected, you will be redirected to the new Share / Move Samples page.

### Destination Project Selection

The first action is to select the destination project. Start typing the name of the destination project in the "Select a
project to share samples with" input. As you type a list of projects will be presented, select the project you want.

### Sample Review

Next you will see the list of samples that were selected.  If you decide you do not want one of them, just click on the (X) at the end of the row.

If a sample has a locked symbol, it means that the sample is locked from modification in the current project and will not be modifiable in the destination project.

### Moving Samples

If you want to move samples, which means they will be in the destination project, but removed from the current project,
then select the checkbox "Remove samples from current project (move samples)"

### Locking Samples (ONLY FOR SHARING NOT MOVING)

If you are sharing samples and you do not want them to be modifiable in the destination project, select the checkbox "Prevent modification of samples in target project (only when copying samples)"

**NOTE: Both checkboxes cannot be selected at the same time.**

### Sharing

Once you are ready to copy / move the samples, click the "Share Samples" button at the bottom of the form.  Once complete, a message stating that the share or move was successful.  From here, you can select to either go back to the samples page, or continue to the destination project.

### Warnings

#### Destination project already has the samples

If the destination project already has **all** of the samples you are trying to copy, you will be shown a message stating this without the possibility to share again.  You can still select another project at this point and continue.

![Share samples no samples.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/samples/share-no-samples.png)

If the destination project already has **some** of the samples you are trying to copy, you will be shown a message saying how many samples cannot be copied.  The list of samples will only display the samples that can be copied.  You can proceed to copy the available samples.
