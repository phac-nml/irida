You can add a new sample to the project if you have the project Manager role on the project. To add a new sample to the project, click on the "Add New Sample" button in the "Samples" menu:

![New sample button]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/samples/add-sample-button.png)

Clicking this button will open the Create New Sample modal dialog.  When creating a sample, you must define the sample name (only upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and the special characters <code>!, @, #, $, %, _, -</code>, and <code>`</code> are allowed) and optionally choose an organism for the sample:

When you've finished choosing the name and organism for the sample, click on the "Create Sample" button.
