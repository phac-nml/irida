All users are permitted to create user groups in IRIDA.

After logging in, click on the **Settings** <i class="fa fa-cog"></i>  menu and select "User Groups":

![Create user group menu.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/users/create-user-group-menu.png)

This will take you to a listing page for all current user groups.  Click on the "Create New User Group" button:

![Create user group button.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/users/create-new-user-group-btn.png)

This will open a modal window which will allow you to fill in the group details fields. Only the group name is required, but you can optionally provide a more detailed description of what the user group is:

![User group details form.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/users/user-group-details-form.png)

On successfully creating a new user group, you will see the user group details that you entered:

![User group details page.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/users/user-group-details-page.png)

By default, your user account is assigned to the group as the group owner.
