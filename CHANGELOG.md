* [Developer]: Packer renames the VM on output.
* [Developer]: The Virtualbox appliance that's built now uses the `virtio` network adapter because the Intel one had serious performance issues over NAT.

* [UI]: Removed the bottom footer and moved links into the Help menu.
* [UI]: Fixed a bug where sorting users on the users table didn't actually sort the users correctly.
* [Developer]: Added support to Galaxy integration to allow different sets of states, (hopefully) allowing the use of newer versions of Galaxy that we prescribe.

1.0.0-alpha5 to 1.0.0-alpha6
----------------------------
* [UI] Feature: Added IRIDA logo to the header, and added a footer with some contact information. Also added a favicon.
* [UI] Feature: Added ability to remove sequencing runs and all uploaded files from the web interface.
* [UI] Feature: Upgrade to the latest version of Phylocanvas for rendering phylogenetic trees from SNVPhyl runs. We were falling back to PhyloSVG in Firefox on Linux because of a bug in Phylocanvas, but the bug has since been fixed, so now everyone gets Phylocanvas!
* [UI] Feature/Bugfix: Updated the "Recent Activities" section to use angular directives. Also fixed a bug with how the links in recent activities were rendered.

* [Developer] Feature: Add forward and reverse links on paired-end sequencing files to the REST API.
* [Developer] Bugfix: Moved the install directories in the VM to reside on `/home` from `/opt` because packer makes a giant home partition and we were running out of space when Galaxy was running in `/opt`.

1.0.0-alpha4 to 1.0.0-alpha5
----------------------------
* [UI] Feature: Announcements section added to dashboard.
* [UI] Feature: Updated the logo in the top, right-hand corner to use the real IRIDA logo.
* [UI] Feature: Project e-mail subscriptions; you may now subscribe to a project to receive daily digest e-mails showing project events.

* [Developer] Removed all unused code for transferring files to arbitrary instances of Galaxy, feature is supported by IRIDA Import tool in NML Galaxy.
